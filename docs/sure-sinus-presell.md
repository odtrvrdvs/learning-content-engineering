# **The Sinus-Clearing Supplement That’s Backed by Bacteria**

**Here’s what I learned after living with 12 years of chronic sinus pain.**

“Good” bacteria isn’t just for your gut.

After years of prescribing harsh antibiotics and nasal sprays for sinusitis, researchers discovered something concerning in their chronic sinusitis patients after taking a closer look.

**Despite years of treatments, their patients’ sinus microbiomes were completely out of whack.**

Tests showed that chronic sinusitis sufferers have a “compromised” sinus microbiome swarming with “bad” bacteria, phlegm, and inflammation.

Researchers also found that **chronic sinusitis sufferers actually have less “good” bacteria than a healthy person has!**

Turns out, **the most efficient way to treat sinusitis is by putting “good” bacteria back into your sinus microbiome - aka, use a “probiotic.”**

However, there was one major problem with probiotics…

Until recently, probiotics were only for the gut! There was no way a probiotic designed for digestion issues could make an impact on the sinuses.

**But thankfully that has all changed.**

## **Introducing Sure Sinus**
After learning about the immense benefits that “good” bacteria had on his own chronic sinusitis, Marc Palumbo founded Sure Sinus, **a company focused on making probiotic sinusitis therapy available and accessible to all Americans.** 

Marc’s own chronic sinusitis had become so serious that he considered walking away from his own passion for business.

> blockquote “My sinusitis started from a toxic mold situation. I was hacking up green and black things that wouldn’t go down the drain. The pain, the fatigue, they were unbearable. I couldn’t focus on my work. At my breaking point, I had tried almost everything. I’d gone through at least seven different types of antibiotics prescribed to me by over three different ENTs. I tried a Neti pot, over the counter meds, and three different types of nasal spray (two that were prescribed!)...you name it, I tried it.  But it’s like my doctors weren’t listening to me. I took matters into my own hands when they said surgery was my last option” said Marc Palumbo, Sure Sinus founder.

Instead of giving up, he put his head down to personally research and navigate his way through the maze of sinusitis cures.

**That’s when Marc discovered the research that pointed him toward probiotics.**

After several years, Marc was able to settle on his own proprietary mixture of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus  -  **the exact probiotic strains that make up a healthy sinus microbiome.**

Marc had put together a combination that changed his life—an actual, tangible and consistent solution for just about anyone suffering from both acute and chronic versions of sinusitis, but how does it work?

## **How Does Sure Sinus Work?**
If you’re suffering from chronic sinusitis, you likely have inflammation caused by “bad” bacteria in your sinuses.

Years of antibiotics and harsh sprays kill off the “good” bacteria and make the sinuses a perfect breeding ground for “bad” bacteria to take over.

Without “good” bacteria, your body isn’t able to fight off the “bad,” struggling to keep your sinus microbiome balanced.

Sure Sinus allows you to reintroduce the “good” bacteria, restoring balance to your sinuses.

These “good”  bacteria produce vitamins and nutrients, support immune response, and protect against carcinogens and unhealthy bacteria.

## **This reduces pain and inflammation by signaling your immune system to relax.**

How to Use Sure Sinus
Sure Sinus is really easy to use. If you’ve ever used a nasal spray, you’re already an expert!

There are only three steps:

1. Sure Sinus’ special blend of probiotics are stored in refrigerated capsules. Remove a Sure Sinus capsule from the fridge and empty it into your Sure Sinus glass nasal spray bottle

2. Add distilled water to the nasal sprayer

3. Spray your Sure Sinus solution into each nostril 1-2 times daily. If you have any additional solution left in your bottle, drink the rest and you’re done!

## **Does Sure Sinus Really Work or Is It Just Another Nasal Spray?**

If you’re like me, you’ve tried everything for your chronic sinusitis. Flashy advertisements on YouTube, weird home remedies on forums, and glowing customer reviews on Amazon promise you the world, but often underdeliver. 

**I’ve been a chronic sufferer of sinusitis for 12 years now and I’m afraid to waste my money on another solution.**

That being said, I did some digging on Sure Sinus to make sure that I’m not getting my hopes up.

I did a quick Google search and I saw that they were fully backed on Indiegogo.

The most impressive thing about Sure Sinus is the fact that it’s backed by science and **its blend of proprietary strains have been researched for over seven years.**

**The founder, Marc Palumbo, worked with doctors and scientists that believed in the product so much that they offered to consult for free!**

After reading that (who does anything for free these days? I had to give Sure Sinus a try to see if it was really worth all the hype.

# **My Personal Experience with Sure Sinus**

**Pre-Day1** - My Sure Sinus package arrived right to my door in just three days, but if you’re less patient you can get yours shipped overnight. I unboxed it immediately and popped my capsules into the fridge to prep for the next morning.

**Day 1** - I got up and immediately went to the fridge to get my Sure Sinus capsules! I usually start my day with coffee and emails, but I was way too excited to start my treatment. I opened the capsules and dumped the contents into the spray bottle, filled it with water, gave each nostril a spray and waited for it to work. I wasn’t expecting much, but started to notice that I was a little less inflamed by the evening.

**Day 2** - Not entirely convinced, I decided to try two doses on Day 2, one in the morning and once in the afternoon. By dinner that night I had already seen a huge difference in my sinus drainage. Having to constantly sniff and wipe your nose is a huge embarrassment when I’m out in public, but I was able to get through dinner without having to leave the table to blow my nose once.

**Day 3** - After taking my two doses today, I met up with a friend for lunch. We both noticed that we were able to get through a FULL conversation without me needing to blow my nose or get distracted by pain or a headache. Not only that, I’m finally able to taste food the way I used to!

**Day 4** - Almost missed my first dose today! I woke up without my usual sinus headache, so I didn’t think about grabbing a tissue or rushing to get relief. I went with two doses again and remembered to drink what was left of the probiotic solution after my two doses to make sure I didn’t miss out on anything. I didn’t have any stomach issues with the probiotics (which is what I was worried about!), so today was a total success!

**Day 5** - It was my day off today, but I got up early just to make sure I didn’t miss a dose after what happened yesterday. It’s hard to believe, but my relief feels almost instant. After what feels like a lifetime of abuse from other treatments, **I just feel like my nose is finally healing.**

After a few days of using Sure Sinus, I’m convinced. 

While my sinuses aren’t 100% perfect (it takes about 30 days to start seeing complete results), I’ve noticed so much improvement that there’s no doubt I’ll be sticking with the protocol.

Unlike prescribed or over-the-counter treatments I’ve tried in the past like antibiotics or saline sprays, I actually feel like Sure Sinus isn’t only relieving my symptoms, it’s **healing the damage chronic sinusitis has caused.**

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. I’m even actively recommending it to friends who also suffer from sinus pain.

Even after your sinuses start to feel great, Sure Sinus is worth having in your self-care toolkit whenever you feel any sinus pressure or inflammation coming on.
